/* Arithmetic Edge Cases

  there are a few special cases to be aware of with JS arithmetic

  knowing these edge cases is more important for debugging your code
  you will rarely (or never) need to do these things on purpose

  but sometimes you'll see a NaN or Infinity show up in your program
  that's usually because you tried operating on bad values

  keep an eye out for these cases!

  using NaN in an operation will make the result NaN
  careful, this is also true of values that coerce to NaN!
*/
